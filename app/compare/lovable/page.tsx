const verdict = `ProductOS and Lovable serve different needs. Lovable is excellent at what it does — generating code from prompts. But ProductOS is designed for the complete product development journey. If you're a founder or product team who needs to go from "I have an idea" to "I have a deployed product," ProductOS covers stages that Lovable simply doesn't address. The research agent, PRD generation, and design stages in ProductOS mean your code is built on a solid foundation of validated requirements. For pure code generation, both tools work well. For building products end-to-end, ProductOS is the more complete solution.`
